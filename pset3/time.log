I discussed my solution with no one.
Major difficulties: understanding how these string functions work and passing char* pointers
String function details are tough!
Have to remember null terminators!
Rescan function is a bit tricky!!! had to make function copylastn that copied remainder or string to be scanned to result variable.
Debugging was difficult, did not understand Explode and crash tests?
Major difficulties included the binary number parity check, and also handling fail cases as specified.
Also was tricky using the caret replacement but managed to get it!!
