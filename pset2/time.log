I discussed my solution briefly with TA Lee Danilek.
No major difficulties encountered thus far, simply getting reacquainted with arrays and passing arguments by value in C.
Major difficulties were not too significant, but just needed to better understand how assignments worked by manually doing them on paper a few times;
Went with a top-down approach for designing this program.
Difficulties with task counting and flag counting finally resolved!
Holy crap! Backtracking was pretty tough. I need to brush up on recursion for sure!
