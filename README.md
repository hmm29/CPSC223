## CPSC223a Data Structures & Programming Techniques: Homework Submissions

> "Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process in which you
  must reach your own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its
  solution."

This repo contains the C programming assignments for CS223: Data Structures & Programming Techniques (SPRING 2016). This is one of Yale's upper-level Computer Science courses. Each submission is evaluated using a public test script and a more comprehensive private script, which determines the final score. This course taught me to think carefully about code readability, design patterns, asymptotic analysis, and programming style.
